# Amazon_Dashboard
Problem statement:
Develop a Sales Insights Dashboard for Amazon, utilizing Power BI to display the top 5 globally profitable products alongside the bottom 5. The dashboard will integrate sales projections, KPIs, product units, and return dates sourced from Excel. This tool aims to provide actionable insights crucial for fostering company growth and strategic decision-making.

Proposed Solution:To visualize the proposed solution effectively, we'll design a user-friendly interface in Power BI. The dashboard will consist of multiple interactive visualizations, starting with a bar or column chart showcasing the top 5 globally profitable products and another chart displaying the bottom 5. These visualizations will dynamically update based on user selections and filters.
Furthermore, we'll incorporate a line chart depicting sales projections over time, allowing stakeholders to track performance trends and make informed decisions. KPIs such as total revenue, profit margins, and customer acquisition cost will be displayed prominently in a summary section. Additionally, a table visualization will provide detailed information on product units, return dates, and other relevant metrics sourced from Excel.
The Power BI dashboard will offer drill-down capabilities, enabling users to delve deeper into specific product categories, regions, or time periods for a more granular analysis. Interactive filters will allow users to customize their views based on their preferences and requirements. Overall, the intuitive design and comprehensive insights provided by the dashboard will empower Amazon's stakeholders to drive company growth and make strategic decisions confidently.

The Power BI dashboard offers a comprehensive view of Amazon's sales insights from 2012 to 2015. It showcases key performance indicators, return dates, sales projections, and product units. Additionally, it identifies the top 10 profitable customers, top 5 profitable products, and bottom 5 products. Sales by segment and market breakdowns provide actionable insights for strategic decision-making within a visually engaging interface.
